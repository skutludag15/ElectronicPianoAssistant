# ElectronicPianoAssistant
This Android application is designed for music students to improve their musical knowledge. This application detects the musical symbols on the musical scores captured via either the gallery or the camera. The selected musical score image can be stored and retrieved from Firebase and it is also sent to the AWS to detect the musical notations by pre-trained YOLOv5 model. Moreover, the positions of staff lines are detected via Python Code written by myself. The derived information is used to play corresponding piano music. The speed of the music can be selected by the user.
